# Chart-Image-Utility
Engineers sometimes find themselves staring at published charts of data in which they need to identify specific points along a curve.  The engineer can  make a rough estimate of an interpolated value or attempt to become more accurate using a pencil and ruler.  

[Chart-Image-Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chart-image-utility/bganllmbacfphdjjnappeajfdjabaild) is a Google Chrome extension built to solve this problem.  It allows users to upload an image of the chart and allows the user to obtain interpolated values. This is accomplished by declaring reference points on the HTML canvas and performing interpolation with the pixel coordinates.
